EmployeeInfoApp
A WPF desktop app for managing employee records with a cyberpunk-themed UI, using MVVM architecture and SPA navigation. It supports two main features: adding new employees and listing all employees, with data stored in a CSV file.
Features
Add Employee

Enter employee details: Name, Father's Name, CNIC (XXXXX-XXXXXXX-X), Designation, DOB (18+ years ago), Gender (M/F), Department (R&D, QA, Productions, Accounts, Admin), Manager status.
Real-time validation checks field requirements.
Saves data to listOfAllEmployees.csv in the output directory.
Shows a success message and resets the form after submission.

List of Employees

Displays employee records in a DataGrid (Name, Father's Name, CNIC, Designation, DOB, Gender, Department, Manager).
Loads data from listOfAllEmployees.csv.
Shows a message if the CSV is missing or empty.
Uses neon colors (green, pink, blue) and glow effects for a futuristic look.

Architecture
SPA Pattern

Uses a single MainWindow with a ContentControl to switch between views (HomePageView, AddNewEmployeeView, ViewAllEmployeesView).
Navigation via NavigateTo method ensures a seamless SPA-like experience in WPF.

MVVM Architecture

Model: Employee.cs defines the employee data structure.
View: XAML files (HomePageView.xaml, AddNewEmployeeView.xaml, ViewAllEmployeesView.xaml) provide the UI.
ViewModel:
AddNewEmployeeViewModel.cs: Handles form input, validation, and CSV saving.
ViewAllEmployeesViewModel.cs: Loads and displays CSV data.


Uses data binding, converters (GenderConverter, StringToVisibilityConverter), and RelayCommand for form submission.
