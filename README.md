EmployeeInfoApp
A WPF desktop application for managing employee records, built with a cyberpunk-themed user interface. The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and implements a Single Page Application (SPA) navigation pattern within a WPF context. It allows users to add new employee records and view a list of all employees, with data persisted in a CSV file.
Features
1. Add Employee

Users can input employee details, including:
Name
Father's Name
CNIC (in format XXXXX-XXXXXXX-X)
Designation
Date of Birth (DOB)
Gender (Male/Female)
Department (R&D, QA, Productions, Accounts, Admin)
Manager status (checkbox)


Input validation ensures all fields meet requirements (e.g., valid CNIC format, DOB not in the future, minimum name length).
Successfully added employees are saved to listOfAllEmployees.csv in the applicationâ€™s output directory.
A success message is displayed, and the form resets after submission.

2. List of Employees

Displays all employee records in a DataGrid with columns for Name, Father's Name, CNIC, Designation, DOB, Gender, Department, and Manager status.
Loads data from listOfAllEmployees.csv.
Shows an informative message if the CSV file is missing or empty.
Cyberpunk-themed UI with neon colors and glow effects for a futuristic look.

Architecture
Single Page Application (SPA) Pattern

The application uses a single MainWindow with a ContentControl to host different views (HomePageView, AddNewEmployeeView, ViewAllEmployeesView).
Navigation is handled via a NavigateTo method in MainWindow.xaml.cs, simulating SPA behavior by swapping views without opening new windows.
Users can navigate between the home page, add employee form, and employee list seamlessly.

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture

Model: The Employee class (Models/Employee.cs) defines the data structure for employee records.
View: XAML files (Views/HomePageView.xaml, AddNewEmployeeView.xaml, ViewAllEmployeesView.xaml) define the UI with cyberpunk styling.
ViewModel: 
AddNewEmployeeViewModel.cs handles input validation, form submission, and CSV writing.
ViewAllEmployeesViewModel.cs manages loading and displaying employee data from the CSV.


Data Binding: Views bind to ViewModel properties using WPFâ€™s data binding, with converters (GenderConverter, StringToVisibilityConverter) for dynamic UI updates.
Commands: The RelayCommand class implements ICommand for handling the submit action in AddNewEmployeeViewModel.
